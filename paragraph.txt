In the aftermath of her father’s death, Ophelia goes mad with grief and drowns in the river.
 Polonius’s son, Laertes, who has been staying in France, returns to Denmark in a rage. Claudius 
 convinces him that Hamlet is to blame for his father’s and sister’s deaths. When Horatio and the 
 king receive letters from Hamlet indicating that the prince has returned to Denmark after pirates 
 attacked his ship en route to England, Claudius concocts a plan to use Laertes’ desire for revenge 
 to secure Hamlet’s death. Laertes will fence with Hamlet in innocent sport, but Claudius will poison
 Laertes’ blade so that if he draws blood, Hamlet will die. As a backup plan, the king decides to
  poison a goblet, which he will give Hamlet to drink should Hamlet score the first or second hits
   of the match. Hamlet returns to the vicinity of Elsinore just as Ophelia’s funeral is taking place.
    Stricken with grief, he attacks Laertes and declares that he had in fact always loved Ophelia. 
    Back at the castle, he tells Horatio that he believes one must be prepared to die, since death 
    can come at any moment. A foolish courtier named Osric arrives on Claudius’s orders to arrange
     the fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes.
